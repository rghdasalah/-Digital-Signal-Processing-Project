ðŸ“Œ Key Objectives

      Design FIR filters using Windowed-Sinc, Least Squares (LS), and Weighted Least Squares (WLS) methods.
      
      Analyze the performance trade-offs of different filter designs.
      
      Apply digital filters to real-world audio signals to suppress interference.
      
      Explore upsampling, frequency analysis, and iterative filtering techniques.
